# FakeLoveTester
A prototype for a "Love Tester" website that emails the user's name and crush name inputs to a specified email (said email features have been removed from this branch)

## No email branch

This branch is essentially the same code as the main branch, except all of the sneaky emailing has been removed. The purpose of this branch is to be able to test the webUI without needing to configure any emails.

## Dependencies

Python 3.x  

Flask  

## Usage

This script will have to be run in a terminal, it can be ran on Windows, Mac or Linux. 

First, change your directory to where you have cloned the repository.

Then, run the webUI.py script

```bash
python3 webUI.py
```

or 

```bash
python webUI.py
```


Next, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser (any web browser will do, chromium and firefox have been tested)
There, you should see the webUI pop up

## Making a fork

This project is a prototype and it may be forked to be used as a base for another project.

## Support

If there are any bugs in the code, feel free to write an issue!

## Authors and acknowledgement

All code in this project was written by me. However, the background image on the webUI was taken from a stock image website.
